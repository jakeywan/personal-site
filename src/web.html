        <h1>Web by Jan Robert Leegte & Superposition</h1>

        <div>
            Web is a fully on-chain generative cross-linked network of 1000 webpages on Ethereum. All pages and the links between them are generated and form a deterministic universe. Each HTML webpage is unique in color and composition as well as the position within the network. Each page has a unique title which is an anagram of 'Document'.

            For this project, I ported the generative JavaScript code on chain, and I wrote a Dutch auction and pricing mechanism that would reduce exponentially over the course of the hour-long auction. Beyond that, I also wrote the web3 code on the website, enabling minting (it was scary—anything not purchased during the hour of the auction would never be purchasable again, so we had to get it right!).
