        <h1>Crypto Certs by Ed Fornieles</h1>
        <div class="section">
            Crypto Certs were an experimental studio funding model deployed by Ed Fornieles in 2018. With the resurgence in interest in the crypto space, he wanted to give it some love and relaunch it. Each certificate contains a private key embedded under a scratch panel. Collectors can “burn” their certificate by scratching to reveal the private key, redeeming a proportional share of the funds in the contract. They're sort of like Fungible Non Tokens (FNTs).

            The designs draw inspiration from early stock certificates, particularly Disney stocks. If you look closely, you'll see Finis represented on them.

            I rewrote the original contract (the original was deployed before frontrunning was widely understood, and was thus highly vulnerable to an exploit) and I'm really proud of the implementation. It combines Merkle trees and off chain signatures in a way that I haven't seen before. I also rebuilt the original website in React and made some modifications to let users purchase certificates.

            This on chain/off chain experience was innovative at the time, and is still a refreshing take on what it means to use the blockchain as a medium. The cert is a physical art object imbued with cryptographic magic powers. It's a blockchain key, given a cute and calculated form. NFTs, while wonderful, can also invite conformity. Everything is built to a specific format, to fit inside a specific rectangle, inside a single marketplace, on a computationally limited world machine.
