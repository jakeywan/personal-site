            A little about me: I have over a decade of experience writing code, shipping products, and managing engineering and product teams at high-growth startups.
            I specialize in JavaScript (React web apps, Node backends), Swift (native iOS), and Solidity (Ethereum).
            <br>
            <br>
            As one of the first 10 hires at <a href="/cameo.html">Cameo</a>, I helped grow the business from seed stage to a $1B+ valuation.
            Now as CTO at <a href="/fini.html">Fini</a> ($2M+ in revenue to date) I manage our engineering and design teams and ship code across iOS, Apple watch, web, and Ethereum smart contracts.
            I've also collaborated with high-profile conceptual artists (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Fornieles" target="_blank">Ed Fornieles</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Robert_Leegte" target="_blank">Jan Robert Leegte</a>) to produce code-based artworks on the blockchain, and I've deployed over a dozen Ethereum smart contracts that are still in frequent use today.

            <h2>1stDibs NFT Marketplace Smart Contract Auditing</h2>
            <div>I conceptualized and built testing and auditing frameworks for a collection of marketplace and auction smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Deliverables included a manual audit with a written report grading potential vulnerabilities from low to high priority, potential performance improvements/gas savings, and 100% end-to-end test coverage using Hardhat across all contracts.</div>

                An on-chain ("in-chain"), generative artwork in collaboration with Dutch net artist Jan Robert Leegte. The work is built of nested bevels, each one sometimes engraved or embossed. Your token hash defines the composition of the ornament.

                A second collaboration with Dutch artist Jan Robert Leegte. Web is a fully on-chain generative cross-linked network of 1000 webpages on Ethereum. All pages and the links between them are generated and form a deterministic universe. Each HTML webpage is unique in color and composition as well as the position within the network. Each page has a unique title which is an anagram of 'Document'.

            <h2>Unix Days</h2>
            <div>Unix Days autonomously paints the color of each day. It runs on the Ethereum blockchain, without dependencies or human intervention. Each color is calculated by hashing the number of days since the Unix epoch (midnight on January 1st, 1970) and interpreting the first 6 bytes as a hex color. This means the color is materially connected to the day itself—it is the color of that day, in some sense. The rhythm might intuitively recall the experience of passing days: infinite gradation, monotonous repetition.
