            A little about me: I have over a decade of experience writing code, shipping products, and managing engineering and product teams at high-growth startups.
            I specialize in JavaScript (React web apps, Node backends), Swift (native iOS), and Solidity (Ethereum).
            <br>
            <br>
            As one of the first 10 hires at <a href="https://cameo.com" target="_blank">Cameo</a>, I helped grow the business from seed stage to a $1B+ valuation—helping with strategy.
            Now as CTO at <a href="https://fini.world" target="_blank">Fini</a> ($2M+ in revenue to date) I manage our engineering and design teams and ship code across iOS, Apple watch, web, and Ethereum smart contracts.
            I've also collaborated with high-profile conceptual artists (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Fornieles" target="_blank">Ed Fornieles</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Robert_Leegte" target="_blank">Jan Robert Leegte</a>) to produce code-based artworks on the blockchain, and I've deployed over a dozen Ethereum smart contracts that are still in frequent use today.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Unix Days</h2>
            <div>Unix Days autonomously paints the color of each day. It runs on the Ethereum blockchain, without dependencies or human intervention. Each color is calculated by hashing the number of days since the Unix epoch (midnight on January 1st, 1970) and interpreting the first 6 bytes as a hex color. This means the color is materially connected to the day itself—it is the color of that day, in some sense. The rhythm might intuitively recall the experience of passing days: infinite gradation, monotonous repetition.
