        <h1>Head of Product at Cameo</h1>

        <div>
            I was one of the first 10 employees at Cameo, back when trying to explain it to people was met mostly with weird looks. I joined Cameo after watching a few of their "reaction videos." I'm still blown away by how reliably Cameos can produce intense emotional reactions in recipients.

        <div>For the few months, the Cofounder/CTO (Devon Townsend) and I worked together out of his Venice Beach apartment. Eventually we graduated to an office space nearby, which we quickly outgrew.</div>

            I helped grow the business through 3 fundraising rounds, ultimately reaching a $1B+ valuation while doing $100m in annual revenue. I built out processes, helped hire our product management and engineering org, shipped new features like Cameo Live and Fan Clubs, managed product strategy and ultimately led a team of product managers at an engineering headcount of over 60.
